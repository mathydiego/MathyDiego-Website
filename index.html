    <p>
        I am not a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bristol, where I
        study logic and the philosophy of mathematics as a member of the
        <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/pluralset/">Set Theoretic
        Pluralism project</a>. I was previously a postdoctoral researcher at the
        University of Aberdeen, and before that I was a graduate student at the
        University of Bristol, where I received my PhD in 2015. The primary
        focus of <a href="/research.html">my research</a> at present is
        philosophical questions about
        <a href="/articles/reverse-maths-intro.html">reverse mathematics</a>.
